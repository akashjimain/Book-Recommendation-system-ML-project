# Book-Recommendation-system-ML-project

Developed a book recommendation system for Amazon customers using memory and model based collaborative filtering by utilizing the description of book consumed and user interests. A recommendation engine is a class of machine learning which offers relevant suggestions to the customer. Before the recommendation system, the major tendency to buy was to take a suggestion from friends. But Now Google knows what news you will read, Youtube knows what type of videos you will watch based on your search history, watch history, or purchase history.

A recommendation system helps an organization to create loyal customers and build trust by them desired products and services for which they came on your site. The recommendation system today are so powerful that they can handle the new customer too who has visited the site for the first time. They recommend the products which are currently trending or highly rated and they can also recommend the products which bring maximum profit to the company.
